/* This program implements a state machine and simulates the operation
 * of it. The machine has the following 4 states: S1,S2,S3 and S2B.
 * The machine has the following 5 inputs: e1,e2,e3,e4 and e5.
 * The state transition diagram cannot be presented here, but it can be
 * figured out by reading the code. For the simulation purposes the idea is
 * to take advantage of a random number generator for producing the input
 * events.
