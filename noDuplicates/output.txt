I
put
about
seventy
jumps
on
my
Hunter
so
far.
Never
flew
the
Freak
myself,
but
did
some
flock
with
Freaks
and
ATCs.
Even
ATCs
have
more
speed
than
Hunter.
There
was
one
jump
in
particular
where
plan
to
fly
at
maximum
performance
very
quickly
left
me
behind.
could
only
maintain
same
glide
ratio
re-join
them
by
cutting
corners
turns.
I'm
guessing
that
will
outperform
easily
this
regard.
