I put about seventy jumps on my Hunter so far. Never flew the Freak myself, but did some flock 
jumps with Freaks and ATCs. Even the ATCs have more speed than the Hunter. There was one jump 
in particular where the plan was to fly at maximum performance and the ATCs very quickly 
left me behind. I could only maintain the same glide ratio and re-join them by cutting the 
corners in the turns. I'm guessing that the Freak will outperform the Hunter easily in this 
regard.
