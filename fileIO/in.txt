Never before have we offered so much recurve riser design and performance at 
such an affordable price. Built on our Grand Prix riser platform, the 
Alero is loaded with tried and true Hoyt Technology that will allow archers 
to excel from the start. The Alero is available in anodize red, blue, black 
and gunmetal gray. Alero is expected to be available January 2018.
